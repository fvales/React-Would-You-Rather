# Would You Rather Project

In the "Would You Rather?" Project is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard. The app is developed using React JS and Redux. This is a project for the Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the React Nanodegree Program.

## App Functionality

The person using the application impersonatins/logs in as an existing user. Once the user logs in, the user can toggle between his/her answered and unanswered polls on the home page, which is located at the root. The polls in both categories are arranged from the most recently created (top) to the least recently created (bottom). Each polling question links to the details of that poll. The application has a leaderboard.
The application allows user to create a new poll.

## Run the project

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
